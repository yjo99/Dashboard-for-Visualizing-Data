The goal of this project is to study machine learning models and
create an interactive program that allows users to enter datasets
and parameters in a given model and view processed data
interactively with the ability to change the model parameters in
real-time.
The program consists of multiple stages, In the frst stage the user
enters the dataset and chooses between supervised and
unsupervised learning, The he can select the model type” Linear
regression, Decision tree, SVM , etc ” the second stage concerns
dataset pre-processing to cleanup the data and extract useful
information, Then the visual representation of the processed data
is created and can be adjusted in real-time by changing the model
parameters.
